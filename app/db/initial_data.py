# Initial data creation for the database, including creating a superuser if it does not already exist.
# This function is designed to be run during application startup to ensure that the necessary initial data is present in the database.
# It checks for the existence of a user with the email specified in the settings (SUPER_USER_EMAIL) and creates a new user with admin privileges if one does not already exist.
# This allows for easy setup of an initial admin user for managing the application without needing to manually insert data into the database.
# The function uses the user_crud.create_user function to create the user, ensuring that the password is properly hashed and that all necessary fields are set according to the UserCreate model.
# The logging statements provide feedback on whether the initial data was created or if it already exists, helping with debugging and monitoring during application startup.
# This approach promotes a smooth initial setup process for the application, allowing developers to quickly get started with a pre-configured admin user.
